# Tracking Barbell Exercises
*Master Project | Abhijeet Thombare | IIT, Guwahati- DS AI, India*

This repository provides all the code to process, visualize, and classify accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained from fitbit smart band. The data was collected during gym workouts where participants were performing various barbell exercises.

#### Exercises

#### Goals
* Classify barbell exercises
* Count repetitions
* Detect improper form 

#### Installation
Create and activate an anaconda environment and install all package versions using `conda install --name <EnvironmentName> --file conda_requirements.txt`. Install non-conda packages using pip: `pip install -r pip_requirements.txt`.
